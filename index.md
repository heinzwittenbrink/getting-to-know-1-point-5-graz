## Our demands for 2030

* Measurable focus of city policy on supply systems that enable a climate-friendly, good life for citizens regardless of their income (energy, housing, leisure, mobility, health).  
* Involve the population by developing and communicating clear benefits. 
* Institutionalisation of climate policy in a way that is comprehensible to citizens 

## 

* clear minimum reduction path (at least 10% per year) with a bundle of possible alternative measures and ongoing steering (by triggering alternative measures, such as greater traffic reduction, if targets are not met), 
* communication channels to exert climate policy pressure on the province of Styria, the federal government and Europe, and close communication with other European cities with similar objectives,_
* Profiling the city (including science and business) as a climate protection model city.
